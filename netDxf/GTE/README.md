The GTE namespace contains classes that have been translated to C# from the Geometric Tools Library original C++ code.

The Geometric Tool Library makes a lot of use of C++ templates and generics to handle, among other things, arbitrary vector dimensions and real numbers. This has no easy translation into C#, therefore the translated code has been limited to use three dimensional vectors (Vector3) with double precision.
